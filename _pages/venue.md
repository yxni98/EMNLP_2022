## FAQs


**Should I follow certain customs when visiting?**

While the UAE is an Islamic country, its culture is shaped by the large number of expats from all over the globe (90% of the population from 150+ nationalities). That said, discretion and modest behavior in public spaces are generally expected.
Public displays of affection between couples of all orientations and genders are generally discouraged.  The local team does not anticipate any problems for women traveling in the UAE.


**Can I drink in the UAE?**

The legal drinking age in the UAE is 21, except in the Emirate of Sharjah, where alcohol consumption is illegal. Sharjah is situated north of Dubai, about 1 hour and 45 minutes from Abu Dhabi by car. Being intoxicated in public is not permitted. Abu Dhabi has a zero-tolerance policy, and there are severe fines and penalties for those caught driving while under the influence. 


<!--  Guidebooks and conversations with colleagues offer many suggestions for polite and appropriate behavior in Abu Dhabi. For example, learn a selection of Arabic phrases and use them when greeting new people.

When you are seated, make sure the sole of your foot is not pointing directly at anyone, as this would be insulting. Use your right hand to offer an item to another person or to receive items. For example, offer your business card with your right hand; you can receive one with both hands. The business week is Monday through Friday. -->
