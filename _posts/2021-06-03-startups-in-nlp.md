<h2> Apoorv Agarwal </h2>

**Apoorv Agarwal** is the Chief Executive Officer and founder of Text IQ, a leading AI company whose products are used by some of the world’s largest enterprises and organizations to identify sensitive information hiding in their unstructured data. Text IQ’s AI is used by its customers to identify unconscious bias within their organization, protect privileged and confidential information, and elevate their privacy programs.

In May this year, Apoorv secured a successful exit by selling Text IQ to Relativity, a $3.6 billion unicorn, which is the legal and compliance platform of choice for the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies and top law firms. By joining hands with Relativity, Apoorv and his team at Text IQ intend to realize their shared vision of bringing the benefits of AI to the world’s largest companies so they can finally discover the truth in their data.

With a natural curiosity towards finding ways to use AI to solve organizational and business problems, Apoorv has dedicated a significant part of his early business and academic career to research and development. During his PhD in Computer Science at Columbia University, he developed the socio-linguistic hypergraph (SLH), which eventually became the core technology behind Text IQ’s products—the same technology that is now being used by some of the world’s most prominent and heavily regulated companies, including 5 out of the top 10 life sciences companies and 4 out of the top 10 banks.

Before Text IQ, Apoorv was a member of the IBM Watson core team, where he developed two patents and received the prestigious IBM Ph.D. Fellowship award.

Before Verneek, Nasrin held senior research positions at AI startups BenevolentAI and Elemental Cognition and was earlier at Microsoft Research and Google. She received her PhD at the University of Rochester working at the conversational interaction and dialogue research group, with her PhD work focused on commonsense reasoning through the lens of story understanding. She has started lines of research that push AI toward deeper understanding and showing basic common sense, with applications ranging from storytelling to vision & language. She has been a keynote speaker, chair, organizer, and program committee member at different AI venues. Nasrin was named to Forbes’ 30 Under 30 in Science 2019 for her work in AI.
